# InfoKloud
A prototype of website that populates data from the database
This was my first real world project after joining a company
The backend is not available in this as i was handling only the front-end ,so everything you see in this project is static and predefined
The Full front-end including the design was done myself without any team.
Index.html is the first page . Productpage.html is where the all the information will be displayed according to what the user search in the Index.html
